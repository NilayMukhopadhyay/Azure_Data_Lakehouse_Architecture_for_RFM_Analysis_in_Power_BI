# About this Customer-Segmentation Project:
This dataset originates from Kaggle and represents the Global Superstore data. It has been deliberately chosen to enable a comprehensive examination of customer behavior through the implementation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. The primary objective of this study is to reveal meaningful patterns using the RFM methodology and to predict potential factors that may influence customer churn in the future.
